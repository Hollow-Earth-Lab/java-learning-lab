# Java Learning Lab: Addition Modules

Welcome to **Java Learning Lab**, a collection of clean, documented console-based programs for practicing programming in Java. Each module is designed with clarity, error handling, and Javadoc documentation — perfect for learning, teaching, or extending.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

This repository contains focused programs:

### 1. `AdditionOfTwoIntegers.java`
- Adds two whole numbers (`int`)
- Validates input using `Scanner.hasNextInt()`
- Handles invalid input gracefully
- Fully documented with Javadoc

### 2. `AdditionOfTwoDecimals.java`
- Adds two decimal numbers (`double`)
- Accepts floating-point input
- Validates input using `Scanner.hasNextDouble()`
- Includes robust error handling and documentation

## 🧠 Why This Matters

These programs are more than just “Hello, World!” for math:
- ✅ Clean separation of logic and input
- ✅ Modular design for reuse and testing
- ✅ Javadoc-ready for API documentation
- ✅ Ideal starting point for building a full calculator or math toolkit
